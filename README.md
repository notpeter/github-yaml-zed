## GitHub Workflows for Zed

A [Zed](https://zed.dev) extension that adds a `GitHub Workflows` language
for GitHub Actions workflow files.

## What it provides

- A language named **GitHub Workflows** backed by Zed's built-in
  `tree-sitter-yaml` grammar (no extra YAML grammar is bundled or compiled).
- Syntax highlighting, bracket matching, outline, and text objects for YAML.
- Injection of [`rmuir/tree-sitter-ghactions`](https://github.com/rmuir/tree-sitter-ghactions)
  inside any YAML string containing a `${{ ... }}` expression, giving rich
  highlighting of operators, identifiers, context accessors
  (`github`, `env`, `secrets`, ...), and builtin functions
  (`contains`, `fromJSON`, `hashFiles`, ...).
- Injection of `bash` into `run:` step values.
- Automatic registration of Red Hat's
  [`yaml-language-server`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server)
  for `GitHub Workflows` buffers, pre-configured with the
  [SchemaStore](https://www.schemastore.org/) JSON Schemas for
  GitHub Actions workflows (`github-workflow.json`), composite/custom
  actions (`github-action.json`), and other GitHub YAML config files
  such as `.github/dependabot.yml`, `.github/FUNDING.yml`,
  issue forms, discussion templates, and release config. This gives
  you completion, hover docs, and validation without any manual LSP
  setup.

## Installation

Install the extension from Zed's extension registry (`zed: extensions`,
search for "GitHub Workflows"), or install it as a dev extension by cloning
this repo and running `zed: install dev extension`.

The first time you open a workflow file, Zed will download
`yaml-language-server` via `npm` into the extension's working directory.
A working `node` binary (managed by Zed) is required.

## Usage

To associate GitHub Actions workflow files with this language, add the
following to your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "file_types": {
    "GitHub Workflows": [
      "**/.github/workflows/*.yml",
      "**/.github/workflows/*.yaml",
      "**/.github/actions/**/action.yml",
      "**/.github/actions/**/action.yaml"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Customizing the YAML language server

The extension registers its own `yaml-language-server` instance under
the LSP name `github-workflows-yaml` (Zed reserves the bare
`yaml-language-server` name for its built-in YAML adapter). User
settings under `lsp."github-workflows-yaml".settings.yaml` are
deep-merged on top of the bundled defaults, so you can add your own
schemas or disable features without losing the bundled GitHub Actions
schemas. For example:

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "github-workflows-yaml": {
      "settings": {
        "yaml": {
          "schemas": {
            "https://example.com/my-custom-schema.json": [
              ".github/my-custom-file.yml"
            ]
          },
          "format": { "enable": true }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
